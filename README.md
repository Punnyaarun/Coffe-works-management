# Coffe-works-management

The coffee works management system is a system where coffee planters/farmers sell their saccp to the coffee works who makes coffee powder out of it and seels it.
There will be a manager who has all access to the system, a clerk who has some limited access to the system and who maintains other workers.
The details of the manager,clerk and farmer will be stored in the database.
